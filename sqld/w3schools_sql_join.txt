//SQL JOIN
//1.
Insert the missing parts in the JOIN clause to join the two tables Orders and Customers, 
using the CustomerID field in both tables as the relationship between the two tables.

SELECT *
 FROM Orders
   LEFT JOIN Customers
       [    ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID    ]  --순서 중요, FROM에 오는 테이블을 ON 바로 뒤에 적는다

//2.
Choose the correct JOIN clause to select all records from the two tables where there is a match in both tables.

  SELECT *
   FROM Orders
[  INNER JOIN Customers    ]
      ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;

//3.
Choose the correct JOIN clause to select all the records from the Customers table plus all the matches in the Orders table.

  SELECT *
   FROM Orders
[  RIGHT JOIN Customers  ]
       ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID; --R/L JOIN에 상관없이 ON 뒤에는 FROM에 있는 테이블이 오나보다.
